### FAQs

###### What is a timeframe?
> Timeframes are arguments only available to the `before` and `after` parameters. Timeframes are constructed by *numbers followed by a letter/work representing the duration*, example `1d` equals 1 day.</br></br>Timeframes can also be stacked on top of each other for more complicated timeframes, example `1d 20h 10m 30s` equals 1 day, 20 hours, 10 minutes and 30 seconds.

###### Discord bulk-delete limitation
> Unfortunately this bot *(like many others)* cannot delete messages older than 14 days in mass amounts, this is due to the discord api limiting the `bulk-delete` endpoint to only delete messages that do not exceed 14 days old.</br>

### Most Common Issues

###### I'm using the `purge` command but it's not working..
>  *This is a common misconception, `purge` is a parameter and should be added after the command `cleanup`. Example `.cleanup purge`*

###### Won't delete messages older than 14 days?
>  *We touched up on why this occurs earlier in the FAQs section, talking about [discord bulk-delete limitations](#discord-bulk-delete-limitation)*

###### I've added the bot to my server but it isn't working..
>  *There could be many number of reasons, the most common though is incorrect permissions inside the channel. Best way to check is make sure the bots (and any of it's roles) aren't denied access to manage messages inside the guild or the channel. If errors persist then feel free to stop by the support server linked below*

###### How do I get a discord id?
>  *Here is a great [support article](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) talking about how to copy ids from users, roles, messages, guilds, etc..*
